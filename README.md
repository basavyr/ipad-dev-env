## Pushing updates to GitHub

In order to push any updates to this repo from the iPad's VS Code app (that uses dedicated server to get the `code-server` running), without intorducing the username and password everytime, the following command must be use in the terminal.

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:basavyr/ipad-dev-env.git
```
