#Study the eigenvectors given by `Linalg` implementation of `numpy`

This script studies the behavior of the results returned by the `eig` implementation found in `linalg` submodule from `numpy`.

The actual type of data structure is relevant to the present study, due to the necessity of having consistency between results given by Python and Mathematica with regards to solving the eigenvalue and eigenvector equation for a Hermitian squared matrix $M$.
